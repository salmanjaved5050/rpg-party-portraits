# RPG - Portraits
A portrait system that is used in many roleplay party based games like **Divinity Original Sin** series and **Neverwinter Nights**. 
You can freely use it and further customize according to your needs. It includes the basic 4 locations where portraits are usually
docked.

# How It Works:
Look for portraits controller script attached to **Portraits** object inside canvas within hierarchy. It has dock location and some other 
properties exposed.

</br> The **Dock Configuration Listing** scriptable object controls the location of the portraits panel, its vertical/horizontal offset 
and spacing between individual portraits.

</br> All of the portraits are draggable and switch positions if they overlap with each other. This can be used to reorganize party portraits 
anytime inside the game. You can disable the dragging from within code if you like.
